This repository provides AI agent skills for working with skill-init.
Skills provide on-demand context and patterns for this codebase.

## 🗣️ Language & Communication

**CRITICAL PROTOCOL:** The model must **ALWAYS** detect the language used by the user and respond in the same language.

*   **User speaks English** → Respond in English.
*   **User speaks Spanish** → Respond in Spanish.
*   **User speaks French** → Respond in French.
*   *(Adapt to any language used by the user)*

## 🚀 Quick Start

### How Skills Work

1. **Auto-detection:** AI detects context and loads appropriate skills
2. **Composition:** Multiple skills can be active simultaneously
3. **Priority:** CORE skills have absolute priority and must ALWAYS be respected

## 🚨 CORE SKILLS - Always Active

**These skills contain the MOST CRITICAL rules that must ALWAYS be respected:**

| Skill | Trigger | Priority | Description |
|-------|---------|----------|-------------|
| **`skill-init-core`** | **ALWAYS** | **CRITICAL** | Core patterns and conventions |
| **`git-conventions`** | **ALWAYS** | **CRITICAL** | Git commit message style and workflow |
| **`knowledge-gap`** | **UNKNOWN PATTERN** | **HIGH** | Protocol for new/undefined patterns |

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** NEVER compromise these rules. They are the foundation of the project.

## 🧬 Protocol for New Patterns (MANDATORY)

**IF** you develop a new feature, architecture, or pattern that is **NOT** covered by existing skills or documentation:

1. **IDENTIFY:** Recognize that you are introducing a new standard or pattern.
2. **PROPOSE:** You **MUST** ask the user if they wish to create a new skill for this pattern.
3. **STANDARDIZE:** If agreed, suggest the structure for the new skill (Description, Trigger, Code Examples).

> **AI Instruction:** *"I notice we are implementing a new pattern for [Concept]. Should we create a skill for this to maintain future consistency?"* (Translate this question to the user's language).

## 🔧 Architecture & Patterns

### Repository-Specific Skills

| Skill | Description | Location (Source) |
|-------|-------------|------|
| `skill-init-core` | Core patterns and conventions | [skills/skill-init-core/SKILL.md](skills/skill-init-core/SKILL.md) |

## ⚙️ Configuration & Sync

Each AI provider requires specific configuration paths. Run `./skills/setup.sh` to sync  to these locations:

| Provider | Config File | Skill Location |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **OpenCode** | `opencode.json` | `.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| **Claude Code** | `CLAUDE.md` | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| **Gemini** | `GEMINI.md` | `.agent/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | N/A (Embedded in instructions) |

## 🎯 Auto-Invoke Rules

### Development Workflow

**ALWAYS invoke skills in this order:**

1. **CORE Skills** (Always Active)
   - Check `skill-init-core` for fundamental rules

2. **Context-Specific Skills**
   - Check available skills in `skills/` (or provider-specific folders)

## 🔄 Sync & Setup

### Sync Skills to AI Tools
```bash
./skills/setup.sh --sync
```

### Regenerate Config Files
```bash
./skills/setup.sh --all        # All formats
./skills/setup.sh --claude     # Claude Code only
./skills/setup.sh --copilot    # GitHub Copilot only
./skills/setup.sh --gemini     # Gemini only
./skills/setup.sh --opencode   # OpenCode only
```
